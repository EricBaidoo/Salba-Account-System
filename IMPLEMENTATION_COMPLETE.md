## 📊 VARIANCE DETECTION

### Alerts Triggered When:
1. **Expense Over Budget**
   - Condition: Actual > Budgeted
   - Display: Red badge showing % overage
   - Example: "Staff Costs 25% OVER BUDGET"

2. **Income Under Target**
   - Condition: Actual < Budgeted
   - Display: Blue badge showing % shortfall
   - Example: "Tuition 15% SHORT OF TARGET"

### Calculation Logic
```php
// Expense overage
$variance_percent = round(($actual / $budgeted - 1) * 100);

// Income shortfall
$variance_percent = round((1 - $actual / $budgeted) * 100);
```
