## ðŸ”§ FILTER FIX FOR view_students.php

The 500 error occurs because of the collation-sensitive filtering logic. Here's the fix:

### **Problem Line (around line 26-28):**
```php
if (!empty($class_filter)) {
    $where_conditions[] = "REPLACE(class, ' ', '') = REPLACE(?, ' ', '')";
    $params[] = $class_filter;
    $param_types .= 's';
}
```

### **SOLUTION - Replace with this:**
```php
if (!empty($class_filter)) {
    $where_conditions[] = "LOWER(TRIM(class)) = LOWER(TRIM(?))";
    $params[] = $class_filter;
    $param_types .= 's';
}
```

### **Why This Fixes It:**
- **LOWER()** - Makes comparison case-insensitive (Creche = CRECHE = creche)
- **TRIM()** - Removes leading/trailing spaces
- **Removes REPLACE()** - Avoids collation conflicts
- **More reliable** - Works across different database configurations

### **Steps to Apply Fix:**

1. **Upload** `test_filter_fix.php` to test the fix first
2. **Run:** https://sms.ericbaidoo.tech/test_filter_fix.php
3. **If successful**, edit your hosted `view_students.php` file
4. **Replace** the problematic line with the fixed version

### **Alternative Quick Fix:**
If you can't edit the hosted file easily, I can create a completely new `view_students_fixed.php` with all corrections applied.

Would you like me to:
A) Create the test script first to verify the fix works?
B) Create a complete fixed version of view_students.php?
C) Just tell you the exact line to change?
